      <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-transgender Legislation affects transgender people in multiple ways</h2>
<div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>Within 2023 alone 467 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in the United States almost all were anti-transgender bills (ACLU 2022). Some are being codified into law, while others never see any Congress floor. Whether these bills are entertained or not, they have a significant effect on transgender people. Due to many of the bills being introduced into law across the country, transgender people are not only having to think about if they will be safe but if they will be able to access the care that has been deemed necessary to protect their physical and mental health.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Gender dysphoria is a significant problem many transgender people face, it also happens to be the target of many bills. Gender dysphoria is described as “Clinically significant distress that a person may feel when sex or gender assigned at birth is not the same as their identity,” (HHS). Some of the treatments used include surgery, hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and therapy. All of these treatments are known as gender-affirming care and are essential to their mental and physical health (HHS). This is important because many transgender people suffer from anxiety and depression at a higher rate than their cisgender peers (Abreu 2022). Even though these treatments are vital and there has been lots of research on their importance, there’s lots of misinformation being spread around on the internet. According to the Journal of Family Psychology (2022), “In a study of 55 TGD young adults who were assessed throughout their transition, de Vries et al. (2014) found that receiving gender-affirming care during adolescence consisting of puberty blockers around 13 years of age, hormone therapy around 16 years of age, and gender-affirming surgery around 19 years of age resulted in long-term positive outcomes such as alleviation of gender dysphoria. ” A common misconception is that these treatments are offered to anyone who asks. In reality, these treatments are only offered after long-term diagnosis and well-documented gender dysphoria. Doctors also make sure that patients are well aware of the decisions they are making (Gerritse et al. 2021). Despite the decision to receive gender-affirming care being a well-calculated one, many are having the decision to receive the care stripped away. The impact of the lack of care and respect transgender people are given is already being seen.</p>
          <p>In a recent article by SIUE’s newspaper The Alestle, many people described having to think about where they could safely live or where they could safely work. “Mariah Mack, a gender non-conforming graduate student studying biology, had to deal with this problem after getting a job interview in Missouri. ‘I was just afraid of introducing myself and my pronouns. ’ Mack said. ‘But it was so much a part of me that it’s like, ‘Maybe I’ll wait for someone else to start that conversation. ’ And also, if I get this job, do I want to live in Missouri? Will that be good for me and my mental health in the long term? Will I be able to be me, or am I going to have to live a little pseudo-life for a while?’” (Wolfe &amp; Darnell 2023). For many this decision is made much harder due to the inherent poverty many transgender people face. “Among LGBT people, transgender people have especially high rates of poverty—29.4%” (ACLU 2019). Due to lack of funds many transgender people are already hardly able to afford gender-affirming care. Moving, sometimes across the country, would not be a viable option for most. Despite the circumstance, many people are still flocking to states that are protecting their rights. Wolfe &amp; Darnell (2023) shared a story stating as much, “‘It's hard for me to be totally intellectual about this topic because I am so emotional about it,’ Stygar said. ‘I have a friend who has a trans-11-year-old boy, and they're considering moving to Illinois. Puberty is quickly approaching, and how does that child get the resources that they need? And so, Illinois is turning into a beacon of healthcare in the Midwest. ’” Illinois is one of the few states in the Midwest that has not passed any laws that would affect transgender people. Four bills have been introduced but none have made it further than committees.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For many transgender people, these bills mean they will not be able to be themselves. They are prohibited from accessing gender-affirming care, from playing sports in school, and they are even prohibited from learning anything about themselves in school. These will start to show consequences, some have been seen already. “Eighty-five parental figures discussed how antitransgender laws and bills have and will continue to impact the mental health and well-being of their TGD child, including (a) depression and suicidal ideation/risk of suicide, (b) anxiety, (c) increased gender dysphoria, (d) decreased safety and increased stigma, and (e) lack of access to medical care,” (Abreu 2022). Although many of these bills are being introduced under the guise of protecting people, they are doing more harm than good.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Due to bills like these, many transgender people will have to fear for their well-being and future. Still, they must continue to live their lives. They will continue to raise money for their care, they will save money to move to safer areas, and they will continue to protest for their rights to be themselves.&nbsp;</p>
